A CuK (λ= 0.15418 nm) radiation source was employed having operating current and voltage of 40 mA and 40 kV, respectively. To determine the chemistry of prepared films, an FTIR spectrometer (ATR-FTIR JASCO 7890) was employed having a measurement range of 4000-500 cm1. The surface morphologies of films, sput-ter coated with 40 nm Au, were investigated by SEM (JEOL JSM-6490A). The film's thickness was measured using a micrometer screw gauge and the mechanical test- ing was carried out by TRAPEZIUM-X universal tensile testing machine (Shimadzu AG- 20KNXD Plus, ASTM D882 standard) with rectangular shaped samples having a size of 5 1cm2.
